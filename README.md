Smart Team Chat UI:-

A lightweight prototype of a Smart Team Chat UI built with React.
The project demonstrates how AI placeholders (like summarizing conversations, suggesting replies, and generating icebreakers) can enhance team communication.

Note: This is only a UI prototype â†’ No backend, no real-time chat.

Objective:-

1.Build a minimal chat interface in React.
2.Show how AI-first features can be integrated with placeholders.
3.Focus on UI/UX only (not backend or actual AI).

1. Install the required packages.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

1. Start the development server.
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
1. Open the project in your browser at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) to view your project.
1. Create your React components and add your styles using Tailwind classes. You can also create new CSS files and import them into your components.

The project is set up to use `postcss-cli` to process your CSS files. You can add your own `tailwind.config.js` file to customize your Tailwind setup.
